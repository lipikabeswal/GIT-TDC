	<![CDATA[<p>The Caribou Woman</p><p>retold by Sylvia A.	Falconer</p><p>Long ago, in Alaska, there lived an old woman with no husband or children. An Eskimo woman with no husband and no children is a sad woman. She must hunt for fish for herself. She must look for berries and roots alone. In the summer she may be lucky to find enough to feed a squirrel, but in the winter she may go hungry.</p><p>This poor old woman had traveled from the great Yukon River down to the mouth of the Kuskokwim River looking for food. She went out on the frozen Kuskokwim Bay and cut a hole in the ice with her bone chisel, piling the ice blocks beside her. The wind was blowing across the bay, and she could feel the cold through her fur parka. She propped her sled beside her and covered it with a grass mat to block the wind. Then she dropped a fishing line into the hole. Occasionally she would catch a tomcod.</p> <p>While she was fishing, she looked out at the tundra, which was flat and covered with snow. The sky was gray, and she could see darker clouds coming over the mountains in the distance. Soon it would snow again, and she had barely enough food for her supper. Then she saw a caribou running toward her. To her surprise, it stopped right in front of her, panting, its tongue hanging out. The old woman had never been so close to a live caribou.</p> <p>Then a strange thing happened. The caribou reached up with its hoof and pulled the skin from its face. Underneath was the face of a woman. "Help me. Please help me," said the caribou woman. "Wolves are chasing me, and I am exhausted. I cannot run any farther."The old woman saw the fear in the caribou woman's face. "You poor thing," she said. She put her fishing pole aside and pushed the ice blocks into a semicircle. "Now you hide right here."The caribou woman lay near the ice blocks. The old woman sat next to her and pulled the mat around them, hiding the caribou woman.  Soon a large pack of wolves came howling over the tundra. The leader stopped near the old woman and pulled up his face skin. Underneath was the face of a man. "Old lady," said the wolf man, "have you seen a caribou? We have been chasing her all day and we have lost her trail.""Yes," said the old woman. "A caribou came running like the wind. She went down toward those mountains. I'm sure she's far away by now.""Not too far for us," said the wolf man. "We shall catch up with her." He pulled his wolf face down and led his pack toward the mountains.The old woman shivered. "How cold-blooded those wolves are," she said to the caribou woman.  "Now you must turn around and run in the direction you just came from. They'll never look for you there."The caribou woman crawled from under the grass mat. "You've saved my life. I can never thank you enough." From inside herself she pulled out a great pile of caribou fat and handed it to the old woman.  "May you always find plenty to eat," she said. She pulled the caribou face down and headed off across the tundra.The old woman cried for joy. She tasted the sweet fat. Now she would have enough to keep her warm all winter.  She dropped her line into the ice hole again and began pulling up cod as fast as she could drop the line.  For the rest of her life she never lacked for fish.  In the summer, she found baskets of greens and berries, enough to share with her neighbors. The Eskimo people say she was rewarded for being kind to the caribou woman. She was never hungry or cold again.<p>"The Caribou Woman" retold by Sylvia A. Falconer from Spider  Magazine's December 1999 issue, copyright (c) 1999 by Sylvia A.  Falconer. Used by permission.]]>
