How could she surprise Mama?</P><BR Type="Line" /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Aleeya got her cup from the bottom cupboard. She opened the refrigerator door and reached for a carton of orange juice. Slowly, Aleeya poured some juice. She drank it.</P><BR Type="Line" /><P ALIGN="LEFT">She opened the refrigerator door again and poked her head all the way in.

She opened the jar of apple butter, scooped out a spoonful, and spread it on the bread the way Mama liked it--not too thick, and evenly to the sides.</P><BR Type="Line" /><P ALIGN="LEFT">A smile grew on Aleeya's face. It grew bigger and bigger as she walked to Mama's room with the delicious bread. &quot;Happy Birthday to Mama, Happy Birthday to Mama,&quot; she sang.</P><BR Type="Line" /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mama was awake. She took the plate and hugged Aleeya tight.</P><BR Type="Line" /><P ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Pretend there are candles,&quot; Aleeya said, &quot;and blow them out.&quot;</P><BR Type="Line" /><P ALIGN="LEFT">Mama closed her eyes and made a wish, then blew out the pretend candles.</P><BR Type="Line" /><P ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Was it a good surprise?&quot; asked Aleeya.</P><BR Type="Line" /><P ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;It was the best birthday surprise ever,&quot; said Mama.</P><BR Type="Line" />
